Welcome to **AI Code Reviewer**, a Python tool built by [AnyMaint](https://anymaint.com) to streamline code reviews using large language models (LLMs). Catch issues, summarize PRs, and even comment directly on GitHub—all powered by ChatGPT, Grok or Gemini. We’re open-sourcing this to share with the community and grow our startup’s footprint!

## Features
- **General Overview**: Get a high-level summary of what a PR does, based on its description and changes.
- **Issue Detection**: Identify potential problems in diffs (ignores unchanged code by default).
- **PR Comments**: Automatically post issues as inline comments on open pull requests.
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Switch between ChatGPT, Grok and Gemini with a simple flag.
- **Deep Review Mode**: Use `--deep` for verbose reviews including non-bug feedback like data migration or documentation; default mode focuses on critical bugs only.
- **SVN Revisions**: Review a single Subversion revision by passing its commit number; issues are printed to stdout (no inline comments).
- **Repository-Specific Rules**: Add `.ai-reviewer.yml` in the repository root to enforce custom review rules and ignore paths.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnyMaint/code-reviewer.git
   cd code-reviewer
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set environment variables:
```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"  # 
   export BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD="your-bitbucket-app-password"  # 
   export BITBUCKET_USERNAME="your-bitbucket-username"  # 
   export BITBUCKET_WORKSPACE="your-bitbucket-workspace"  # by default username will reused
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"  # For ChatGPT
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-key"  # For Gemini
   export XAI_API_KEY="your-x-key"     # For Grok
   export GITLAB_TOKEN="your-gitlab-token" # For GitLab
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1" # For ollama or self-managged instance of OpenAI-compatible LLM.
   export OPENAI_MODEL=llama3.1:8b #
```
## Usage
There are 2 scripts - `describe-pr.py` for general PR summary and `review.py` for issues and comments.

There is an article how to use the tool. 
It may be outdated, but it is a good start: [How to Use AI Code Reviewer](https://medium.com/itnext/ai-code-reviewer-automate-your-code-reviews-137bfaa20e8b)

- **General PR Summary using Gitlab:**:
```bash
      python describe-pr.py "owner/repo" 123 --vcsp gitlab
```
- **List Issues Only Using Grok **:
```bash
   python review.py "owner/repo" 123 --mode issues --llm grok
```
- **List Issues with Verbose Feedback Using ChatGPT**:
```bash
   python review.py "owner/repo" 123 --mode issues --llm chatgpt --deep
```

- **Post Comments to PR in GitHub with Gemini**:
```bash
   python review.py "owner/repo" --pr 123 --mode comments --llm gemini
```
- Add `--full-context` to include whole files, or `--debug` to see LLM requests.
- **Review an SVN Revision (no comments, issues printed)**:
```bash
   python review.py "https://svn.example.com/repos/project/trunk" 527 --vcsp svn
```
  Optional: set `SVN_USERNAME` / `SVN_PASSWORD` (and `SVN_TRUST_FAILURES` for cert errors) to avoid interactive prompts.

## Repository Rules (`.ai-reviewer.yml`)
Create `.ai-reviewer.yml` at repository root to customize review behavior:

```yaml
version: 1
review:
  global_must:
    - "Flag SQL string interpolation as a bug."
  global_avoid:
    - "Do not suggest style-only improvements unless --deep is used."
  ignore_paths:
    - "docs/**"
    - "migrations/**"
  path_rules:
    - paths: ["backend/**/*.py"]
      must:
        - "Flag broad except Exception without logging or re-raise."
```

Behavior:
- Rules file is read from the PR head version (`head_sha`) so PR updates to `.ai-reviewer.yml` are applied immediately.
- If `.ai-reviewer.yml` is not changed in the PR, it is still read from repository at PR head ref.
- Files matching `ignore_paths` are excluded from review input.
- If all changed files are ignored, no LLM API call is made.
